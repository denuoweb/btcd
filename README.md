btcd
====
btcd is an alternative full node htmlcoin implementation written in Go (golang).

It properly downloads, validates, and serves the block chain using the exact
rules (including consensus bugs) for block acceptance as Htmlcoin Core.  We have
taken great care to avoid btcd causing a fork to the block chain.  It includes a
full block validation testing framework which contains all of the 'official'
block acceptance tests (and some additional ones) that is run on every pull
request to help ensure it properly follows consensus.  Also, it passes all of
the JSON test data in the Htmlcoin Core code.

It also properly relays newly mined blocks, maintains a transaction pool, and
relays individual transactions that have not yet made it into a block.  It
ensures all individual transactions admitted to the pool follow the rules
required by the block chain and also includes more strict checks which filter
transactions based on miner requirements ("standard" transactions).

One key difference between btcd and Htmlcoin Core is that btcd does *NOT* include
wallet functionality and this was a very intentional design decision.  See the
blog entry [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20171125143919/https://blog.conformal.com/btcd-not-your-moms-bitcoin-daemon)
for more details.  This means you can't actually make or receive payments
directly with btcd. 

## Requirements

[Go](http://golang.org) 1.16 or newer.

## Installation

https://github.com/denuoweb/btcd/releases

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

- Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

NOTE: The `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` above must not be the same path.  It is
recommended that `GOPATH` is set to a directory in your home directory such as
`~/goprojects` to avoid write permission issues.  It is also recommended to add
`$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` at this point.

- Run the following commands to obtain btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/denuoweb/btcd
$ GO111MODULE=on go install -v . ./cmd/...
```

- btcd (and utilities) will now be installed in ```$GOPATH/bin```.  If you did
  not already add the bin directory to your system path during Go installation,
  we recommend you do so now.

## Updating

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Run the following commands to update btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/denuoweb/btcd
$ git pull
$ GO111MODULE=on go install -v . ./cmd/...
```

## Getting Started

btcd has several configuration options available to tweak how it runs, but all
of the basic operations described in the intro section work with zero
configuration.

#### Linux/BSD/POSIX/Source

```bash
$ ./btcd
```
